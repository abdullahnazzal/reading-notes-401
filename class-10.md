## **Stack**:

**A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.**

Common terminology for a stack is

-   **Push** - **Pop** - **Top** - **Peek** - **IsEmpty**

Stacks follow these concepts:

-   FILO: 
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

-   LIFO: 
Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## **Queue**:

**Common terminology for a queue is**

-   **Enqueue** - **Dequeue** - **Front** - **Rear** - **Peek** - **IsEmpty** 

Queues follow these concepts:

-   FIFO: 
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

-   LILO: 
Last In Last Out
