## **Encryption, decryption, and cracking**
One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.

**Encrypting a message**

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:

```SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE```

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

```YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK```

**Decrypting a message**

According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

**Cracking the cipher**

Imagine that a very literate and savvy enemy intercepts one of Caesar's messages.

```RZ VMZ WMDIBDIB VGG AJMXZN OJ EJDI RDOC XGZJKVOMV OJ YZAZVO OCZ ZIZHT LPZZI VO OCZ IDGZ YZGOV```

That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.

There are three main techniques he could use: 
frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.

## **Caesar cipher**
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 

The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.
