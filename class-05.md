## **Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency**:

**Big O(oh) notation** is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

    Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity).
    The amount of time a function needs to complete.
***
    Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity).
    The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

**O(1)** function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm.

**O(n)** function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.

## **Linked Lists**

**What is a Linked List**

A Linked List is a sequence of **Nodes** that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each **Node** references the next **Node** in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - **Singly** and **Doubly**. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

**Singly** 
- Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A **Singly** linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the **Next** node in a linked list.

**Doubly** 
- Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A **Doubly** linked list means that there is a reference to both the **Next** and **Previous** node.
