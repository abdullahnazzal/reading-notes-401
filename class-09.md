## **Dunder Methods**:

**What Are Dunder Methods?**

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example **__ init __** or **__ str __**.

**Enriching a Simple Account Class**

Throughout this article I will enrich a simple Python class with various dunder methods to unlock the following language features:

-   Initialization of new  **__ init __**
-   Object representation **__ str __**, **__ repr __**
-   Enable iteration **__ len __**, **__ getitem __**, **__ reversed __**
-   Operator overloading (comparison) **__ eq __**, **__ lt __**
-   Operator overloading (addition) **__ add __**
-   Method invocation **__ call __**
-   Context manager support (with statement) **__ enter __**, **__ exit __**

## **Statistics - Probability**

When studying **statistics** for data science, you will inevitably have to learn about **probability**. It is easy lose yourself in the formulas and theory behind **probability**, but it has essential uses in both working and daily life. We’ve previously discussed some basic concepts in descriptive **statistics**; now we’ll explore how **statistics** relates to **probability**.

**What is probability?:**

At the most basic level, **probability** seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of **probability** is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

1-  Flipping a heads

2-  Flipping a tails
