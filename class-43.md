## **What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?**

For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it. The thought of contributing to something that requires a good amount of time without getting a dime for their work can be hard to fully understand.

While each person may have different individual motivations, here is a list of some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:

1. Improve Coding Skills.
2. Gain Early Experience.
3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition.
4. Greater Job Prospects.
5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.
