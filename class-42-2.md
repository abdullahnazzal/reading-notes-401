# **Ethics**

## **Ethics in the workplace**

We should be responsible for the coding we write, because some time we might work on  projects that involved a drug, provide spying or provide pornographic content.


**Here is a sad story that happened with  Bill Sourour [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)**

Some of company might force employees to work on unEthics project like what happened with GOOGLE

**[The employee backlash over Google’s censored search engine for China, explained](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)**

So , I should always try to think twice about the effects of my code before I write it. I hope that you will too.

## **Ethics in Technology**

If you ride your self-drive safety and surprisingly a school bus appears, one driven by a human, and it veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.

What should happend next **Does the car**:

- A.  Swerve sharply into the trees, possibly killing you but possibly saving the bus and its occupants?

- B.  Perform a sharp evasive maneuver around the bus and into the oncoming lane, possibly saving you, but sending the bus and its driver swerving into the trees, killing her and some of the children on board?

- C.  Hit the bus, possibly killing you as well as the driver and kids on the bus?

what should a self-driving car — programmed in advance — do?

Or in any situation — even a less dire one — where a moral snap judgment must be made?
